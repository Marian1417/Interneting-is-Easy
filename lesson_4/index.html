        <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
        <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

        <h2>Headings</h2>
        <p>
            Headings define the outline of of your site. There are six levels of headings.</p>

            <h2>Lists</h2>
            <p> This is how we make an unordered list:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
                <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
                <li>They dont need to be in any particular order</li>
            </ul>

           
            <p>This is what an ordered lists look like:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
                <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
                <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
                <li>You should be noticing thins in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
            <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>

            <p>Other times, you need to <strong>strongly</strong> emphasize the importance of a word or a phrase</p>

            <strong><em>And sometimes you need to shout!</em></strong>

            <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

            <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
